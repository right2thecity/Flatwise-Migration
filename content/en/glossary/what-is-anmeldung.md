Anmeldung is your city registration. It enables you to get a tax ID, library card, and access other services. You need to make an appointment for this at the BÃ¼rgeramt ideally within a month of arriving in Germany. You need to bring your rental contract as proof of address to your Anmeldung appointment.

If your subletter/main tenant says "no Anmeldung possible," that is a sign that the sublet is illegal (not cleared by the landlord). You should really try to get an apartment where you can register, as having a rental contract also brings you a lot of other protections.
