The rental guarantee is by definition a guarantee for a rental relationship. The guarantor is thus liable for the tenant if the latter does not pay his rent or the Nebenkosten or does not meet another demand of the landlord.

In addition, the guarantee for a tenant can protect the landlord against damage caused by the tenant: If the tenant breaks something in the apartment, the guarantor must pay the landlord the cost of repairing the damage if the tenant himself is unable to do so.

Particularly in the case of young tenants who do not yet have a fixed income, landlords want to protect themselves against possible insolvency and therefore often require a guarantee to be deposited with the rental agreement.

In many cases, this rent guarantee is then taken over by the parents (parental guarantee).

But also friends or other private persons can take over the guarantee for the rent. To be able to be used as a guarantor, two conditions must be met:
- The person must have reached the age of 18.
- The person must be financially able to stand in for the tenant in the event of damage. Landlords usually require proof of this. (Income proof)
