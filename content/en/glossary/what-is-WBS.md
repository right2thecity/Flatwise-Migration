The Wohnberechtigungsschein is the official proof in Germany that you can move into a publicly funded WBS apartment. The WBS is the document with which you can prove that you are entitled to such a subsidized rental apartment with WBS.

The legal basis for the Wohnberechtigungsschein is the § 5 Wohnungsbindungsgesetz (WoBindG) in connection with the § 27 Abs. 3 to 5 Wohnraumförderungsgesetz (WoFG) issued.

The Wohnberechtigungsschein is intended to provide affordable housing for low-income households. To qualify, you must earn less than the WBS income limits. But be careful. The WBS certificate is a state matter! This means that each federal state regulates the income limits differently.

You must apply for a housing entitlement certificate at the city, district or municipal administration. As a rule, the housing office is responsible for you. You can download the application form for a housing entitlement certificate from the homepage of your place of residence. The application forms may vary depending on the state and municipality. On this page you will find a selection of cities and districts. There you will find all the necessary information. Alternatively, you can find the forms on the homepage of your city council.
The application for a WBS takes between 2 and 4 weeks. There is an income-related processing fee when you apply. The amount has to be paid in cash and varies between 5 and 25 Euros depending on the place of residence.

You must submit the following documents for a WBS:

- Application form for WBS
- Income declaration (proof of income for the last 12 months)
- Income certificate (filled out and signed by the employer)
- Registration certificate from the Residents' Registration Office (copy)
- Identity document (copy)
If applicable to you: 
- Declaration of partnership
- Declaration of joint custody
- Birth certificate of your children (copy)
- Marriage certificate (copy)
- Disability certificate (copy)
- Proof of alimony paid
