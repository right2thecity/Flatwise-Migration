This type of contract allows the landlord to increase your rent in line with inflation (%) every year. This means your rent will go up annually, so it is not an ideal type of contract. The % added to the rent corresponds with the inflation increase of the previous year. The high inflation of 2023 could therefore still affect your rent in 2024. If you have already signed a contract like this, don’t panic! There is still scope to negotiate - the rent increases could be illegal. Ask a renters’ union to check the contract. You may be able to negotiate a cap for the rent increases over a certain number of years, for example.
