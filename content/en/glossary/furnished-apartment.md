A furnished apartment includes most of the basic equipment that you require. Your rent usually includes internet & electricity. The rent is much higher, as you are also "renting" the furniture as well. Furnished apartments are a decent solution, when you are new to Germany. You can:

- Do your city registration (Anmeldung)
- Rent them almost immediately, even from your home country
- Easier to find than an unfurnished apartment

Although the rent is higher, it's not a guarantee to get the place if you apply. You will still be evaluated by the landlord.

You can find furnished apartments on websites like Spotahome, Wunderflats, Housing Anywhere.
