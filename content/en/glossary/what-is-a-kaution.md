This is your deposit - it should be no more than 3x your cold rent. The landlord should put it in a shared or separate account and send you proof of this. You are entitled to receive any interest accrued on it along with the rest of the deposit when your tenancy is over. Unfortunately, the landlord has up to 6 months to return it to you!
