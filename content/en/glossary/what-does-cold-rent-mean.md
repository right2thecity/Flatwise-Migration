Cold rent (*Kaltmiete*) is the basic rent you pay for the apartment. This is fixed per month and you pay additional expenses on top.

Cold rent does not include:

* Heating
* Expenses for cleaning trash
* Internet
* Electricity

You pay 3x your cold rent to your landlord as the **deposit**. They must return it to you when you leave the apartment. If applicable, landlords can deduct charges for your apartment maintenance, fixing things, etc and return the balance.
