This is a graduated rent which will increase over time by limited amounts i.e. 10%. It is something to watch out for, as some housing websites offer a cheap rent for 3/6 months, which then increases after that point. It should be included in your contract. If you have already signed a contract like this, don’t panic! There is still scope to negotiate - the rent increases could be illegal. Ask a renters’ union to check the contract. You may be able to negotiate a cap for the rent increases over a certain number of years, for example.
