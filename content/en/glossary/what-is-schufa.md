A SCHUFA is a credit check obtained by not totally transparent means by a private company. You will need a German bank account (N26 is easy to get as it requires fewer documents or Anmeldung) in order for the check to occur. You often need to provide your SCHUFA certificate to prospective landlords. It costs 29.95EUR. [https://www.meineschufa.de/de/ ](https://www.meineschufa.de/de/)
