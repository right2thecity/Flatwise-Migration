There is no furniture in the apartment and it will be empty. You might find a stove and a sink but that is all.  

You will have to get your own:

- Bed
- Kitchen - Probably the most expensive part
- Internet connection - takes a few weeks. Internet providers are not quick to setup connections, or anything really.
- Switch your electricity provider - Electricity is available by default, although that can get expensive
- Furniture - tables, chairs, lights, etc.
- Washing machine, fridge, dish washer, etc.
