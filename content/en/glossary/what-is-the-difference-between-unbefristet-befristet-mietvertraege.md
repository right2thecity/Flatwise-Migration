An unbefristet Mietvertrag is an unlimited rental contract. Normally these come with a minimum rental period, often 2 years. This means that if you want to move out before the end of these 2 years, you need to give 3 months notice and find a suitable tenant to replace you. Watch out though, because if you are renting from a private landlord, they are able to take the property back if they or a family member want to move into it. They have to give you 3 months notice in this case (or only 2 weeks if you are renting a furnished sublet!). 
A befristet Mietvertrag is a fixed-term contract, for example 6 months or 1 year. The time limit is annoying of course, but it can give you security, as your landlord/subletter is not allowed to take it back from you before this date, even if they want to move in (Olivia has recently tested this out through the Mieterschutzbund, so if they say something different, they are wrong!). 
Again, the all important thing here is that you have a properly written contract, signed by both you and your landlord. This will protect your rights and enable you to seek advice from a renters’ union.
