Because the market is so competitive, scams are common! The key things to remember are:

- Never pay a deposit or transfer rent before you’ve seen the flat.
- Check the landlord’s credentials as much as you can - find their website; see if you can find online reviews; call their office number; check they’re not using multiple numbers.
- Try to ask neighbours in the Haus whether they can confirm that the flat you’ve seen is indeed available.
- Don’t bother with any landlord who says they’re not in the country so they will have to manage the process remotely.
- Try to use accredited flat-search sites (i.e. not Craigslist or Kleinanzeigen).
- If you are given keys while at the flat, check they fit the door.
- If you are paying a deposit, ask them to show proof that they’ve set up a separate shared Kaution account.
