## Step 1
Just getting started on your flat-search journey? Open up our guide and get informed about where to look, application writing, and most importantly, your rights as a tenant.  

[Flat Hunting in Berlin: A Guide](/en/guide/)

## Step 2
You thought you knew what you were doing, but you just read the word **Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung** and now you’re lost? Check out our [Glossaries](/en/glossary/) page!

## Step 3
You’ve found some places online and you want to check them out. But first you need to prepare a bunch of documents. These are some of the essentials: 

### [Schufa](/en/glossary/what-is-schufa/)

Many landlords in Berlin require a tenant to provide a Schufa credit report in order to rent a flat. This report is used to assess the tenant’s creditworthiness and ability to pay rent on time.

Anyone can get a Schufa, but for newcomers it’s tricky, as the less information Schufa has on you in Germany, the harder it is to get a high credit score. Getting a German bank account and a German phone contract (which you pay on time) will help.

You can [order your Schufa certificate here](https://www.schufa.de) for around 30 Euro. It’s valid for 6 months. 

### [Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung](/en/glossary/what-is-mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung/)

The Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung is a certificate that shows that you do not have any outstanding debts related to your previous tenancy in Germany. The majority of landlords will ask prospective tenants for a copy. This certificate is issued by your previous landlord, and it is important to make sure that you get this before you move out of your old flat. (If you have just moved to Germany, you don’t technically need it, although we’re sure asking your former landlord wouldn’t hurt!).

### Privathaftpflichtversicherungsschein

A Privathaftpflichtversicherungsschein is a type of insurance certificate in Berlin which is required when you are looking for a flat. It is a document that is issued by a private insurance company. It can be used as proof that you have a valid third-party insurance policy that means you could pay out for any accidental damage you caused to the flat or your neighbours. 

### [Bürgschaftserklärung](/en/glossary/what-is-b-guarantor/)

If you are a student or on a low income, you might want to give your landlord a Bürgschaftserklärung, or ‘guarantor form’ in English. If you have a partner / parent / friend / guardian who earns more than you do, they can sign the form to confirm that they will be responsible for the rent if you can’t pay it. Even if they have no intention of doing this, and you know you’ll be able to keep up with rent payments, it might reassure the landlord enough to trust you with the flat.

Once you’ve gathered everything together, it’s time to write your application letter. [Here you can find a template in German and English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ml-2taKWwS9D6CeKwKzC2j4TklmW-NWs6eS8BogACgg/edit?usp=sharing): just add your details!

## Step 4
Realised you could be eligible for a [Wohnungsberechtigungsschein (WBS)](/en/glossary/what-is-wbs/), i.e. access to cheaper rents? Check out these handbooks made specially for non-Germans.
[WBS Handbook 1](https://germanyso.com/en/how-to-berlin/settle-down/english-guide-to-wohnungsberechtigungschein-wbs-for-flat/)
[WBS Handbook 2](https://handbookgermany.de/en/wbs)

## Step 5
Oh my gosh, you’ve found a flat! Now we seriously recommend joining a renters’ union. They’re about 40 Euro a year in subscription fees and provide all the tenancy rights advice you need, plus legal support when necessary. Even if you think your landlord would never try to mess you around, a renters’ union membership will give you peace of mind. (And let’s be honest, they probably will). There are  a few unions out there, here are two examples: 

[Mieterschutzbund](https://www.mieterschutzbund.de/) and
[Berliner Mieterverein](https://www.berliner-mieterverein.de/)

## Step 6
You’re settled into your flat. But you’re having some issues with your landlord. Get clued up on your rights on all sorts of issues here:

- Neighbour angst about music?: [Music Rights](https://www.berliner-mieterverein.de/recht/infoblaetter/info-94-musik-in-der-mietwohnung-was-erlaubt-ist-und-was-nicht.htm)
- Want to get a dog? Look no further: [Pet Advice](https://www.bmgev.de/mietrecht/tipps-a-z/artikel/haustiere/)
- What to do about mould and moisture in the flat: [Mould and Moisture](https://www.bmgev.de/mietrecht/tipps-a-z/artikel/feuchtigkeit/)
- [Here you can find lots of different template letters](https://www.bmgev.de/mietrecht/musterbriefe/) you might need to send to landlords once you have a flat.

## Step 7
You’re having a lovely time in your flat, thinking it’s all too good to be true. And maybe it is: an [Eigenbedarfskündigung](/en/glossary/what-is-an-ebk/) letter arrives. 

Eigenbedarfskündigung - or an owner-occupancy termination notice - is unfortunately an increasing problem in Berlin. It allows landlords to evict you from your flat to use it for their own personal needs (e.g. to move themselves or a relative in, or to sell it). But worry not, there are options available if this happens to you. It’s important to reach out to your network, fight back and publicise what’s happening to you! Here you can find useful leaflets, produced by the Kreuzberg group, Eigenbedarf Kennt Keine Kündigung.

## Step 8
You’ve fought off your landlord, you’re feeling at peace, when one day the rent goes up - way up. You check the [Mietspiegel](https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/wohnen/mietspiegel/) (more info in the guide in Step One!) and realise it might even be illegally high. Speak to your renters’ union and get ready to write a letter to signal your intention to enact the [Mietpreisbremse](https://www.bmgev.de/mietrecht/musterbriefe/detailansicht/article/mietpreisbremse-einfache-ruege-fuer-mietvertraege-ab-2019/). 

## Step 9
You’re still enjoying life in your reasonably priced apartment, but it’s time to move on. Now you need to write a [Kündigungschreiben](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrVSan-ZrMo2mOprYhETlp501BhaOS5O/edit?ouid=105042301035107932863&rtpof=true&sd=true&usp=sharing) - a letter of termination. 

And it must be a letter, not an email, that you actually post - we know, post! - to your landlord. We recommend sending it with registered post - per *Einschreiben* or *Zustellungsbescheinigung* - so your landlord can’t pretend it didn’t arrive. You need to give 3 months’ notice of termination, and if you’re still in your minimum rental period (the Mindestmietdauer - usually 1-2 years), you are responsible for finding a new tenant.
