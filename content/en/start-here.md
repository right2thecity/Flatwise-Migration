[Flat Hunting in Berlin: A Guide](/guide/)

One of the first things you’ll notice when looking for a flat in Berlin is how many long words and specific terms there are! To help, we have created a glossary of terms related to the German Rental Market in five languages.

This glossary provides a comprehensive list of terms and definitions that are used in the rental market, making it easier for everyone to understand the language and find the right words when communicating with landlords, tenants and other stakeholders.

Eigenbedarfskündigung - or an owner-occupancy termination notice - is unfortunately an increasing problem in Berlin. It allows landlords to evict you from your flat - when you’ve finally found one! - to use it for their own personal needs (e.g. to move themselves or a relative in, or to sell it). There are some options available if this happens to you - and it’s important to reach out to your network and publicise the issue! We have translated an excellent information leaflet - with helpful tips! - on this issue, produced by the Kreuzberg group, Eigenbedarf Kennt Keine Kündigung.
