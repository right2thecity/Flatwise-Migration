## Why is the Berlin rental market so difficult?
- Years of speculation following the 2008 financial crash by foreign investors. 
- Investors buy flats and leave them empty while they wait for price to rise before re-selling.
- Berlin council owns insufficient public housing or land. Social housing decreases each year.
- Lots of bureaucracy and rising building costs.
- Protective tenancy laws mean that people are reluctant to move and lose their low rent contracts.
- Subletting is legal, which mean that many people with low rental contracts would rather sublet their flat to friends when moving away than give up their contract.
- Exchanging flats when needs change is common.
- Landlords require lots of different documents from prospective renters. 
- Because it is competitive, unhealthy power dynamics and demands have become the norm. 


## First: decide what it is you’re looking for
- Do you want a flat to yourself? If so, 1/2/3 zimmer? 
- Are you willing to share and take a WG? If so, with how many people? Are you looking for a particular community to share with?
- Do you want a long-term place?
- Do you want somewhere unfurnished? What about a kitchen (EBK)?
- Are you happy to pay extra for a furnished place?
- What’s your budget? Remember to factor in extra bills.
- Does location matter to you?
- Does outdoor space matter to you? 

This will help to focus your search criteria, so you’re only looking at sites and adverts that interest you
- 3 zimmer - 2 bedrooms, 1 living room
- 2 zimmer - 1 living room, 1 bedroom
- 1 zimmer  - 1 bedroom 

## Where to look
- Immoscout, Immowelt, WG-Gesucht apps/websites: some people recommend just focusing your search on these and being very quick with your responses. (search: Aktualität: neueste zuerst)
- Ebay Kleinanzeigen: increasingly popular for private landlords.
- Facebook groups: Housing in Berlin, Co-Housing in Berlin, Berlin Student Flat Exchange, International Women in Berlin Housing, Find Housing for Rent in Berlin, Apartments Berlin - Indians. Berlin  groups with smaller networks sometimes have more opportunities. 
- Wunderflats and Housing Anywhere: furnished flats that could be good for a short term stay when you arrive. 
- Specific instagram profiles: e.g. https://instagram.com/queer.trans.housing?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=  for the LGBTQ+ community. 
- Big real estate corporations: Deutsche Wohnen, Gesobau, BUWOG, Vonovia. 
- HOWOGE and Studierendenwerk student villages (Studentendorf) - but often long waiting lists!
- Ask friends/acquaintances/vague contacts who know their landlord for the landlord’s contact details, and ask them if they have any flats available. 
- Discover the private owners of buildings and email their office. 
- https://telegramchannels.me/bots/berlinflatsbot
- Write a creative letter describing your situation and pin it in the area you want to live. We can help you with this.
- Search @flats_Berlin_bot on Telegram. https://telegramchannels.me/bots/berlinflatsbot
- Look for unnamed doorbells then try to find out who owns the building and email/call them.
- Look for newly built flats and check the scaffolding/signage for which housing developer is responsible, then email/call them.

Paying for Immoscout plus etc doesn’t seem to be worth it, especially if you have time to dedicate to the search anyway. 

## Wohnungsbaugenossenschaften 
Social housing cooperatives (Wohnungsbaugenossenschaften) do not operate on the open housing market, but supply their members. About 12 % of more than 1.6 million rental apartments in Berlin are owned by cooperatives. Their members make a one-time contribution to the cooperative's equity capital, which is repaid in full when they leave. Often long waiting lists, but great chances of finding long-term accommodation for reasonable prices.

## What is a Wohnberechtigungsschein (WBS)? 
With a Wohnberechtigungsschein (WBS), you can move into an apartment ("social housing") that has reduced rents because it is supported by public funds.
 
To get a WBS you have to have a residence permit that is valid for at least 1 year, or be German, or be a EU-Member.

You can apply for more than one person if the persons are related or both persons submit a declaration of partnership. (Marriage or family applications make it possible to apply for more than one person!) If you would like to establish a residential community, a joint application is not possible. (No WG applications possible)

[You apply for WBS here](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120671/) All documents required and the forms are being provided on this page. Unfortunately only in German, so use deepl.com or google translate to understand the requirements in Detail. Send it to your local district.


## Writing a profile for housing websites

Upload all the documents required:
- Passport and residence status
- Proof of income/savings/scholarship/other means of paying for rent 
- Guarantor form if required  (Bürgschaftserklärung)
- Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung (if you’ve lived in Germany before)
- SCHUFA
- Work contract / Student contract 
- Photo of yourself 
- Personal Versicherung ([liability insurance](https://www.check24.de/privathaftpflicht/))

### Details:
- Proof of income: Last 3 payslips or work contract
- Proof of identity: For German / EU citizens, a copy of your national ID is sufficient. If not an EU citizen , you may  need to submit a copy of your passport and residence permit (Blue Card, Permanent Residence, etc).
- Bürgschaftserklarung - guarantor form, optional: When you can’t quite afford the rent, or the landlord is sceptical of your abilities to pay rent (e.g. if you are a student or freelancer), you can ask a friend or family member to sign this form which guarantees that they would cover the rent if you cannot. You would then ask the family member to sign the form and give it to the landlord along with photocopies of their ID or other proof of connection to you. 
- Rent debt free certificate (Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung): This proves that you don't owe any rent to your current / previous landlord. It is your right to request this from the landlord and they must provide it to you if you are not in arrears. If you're new to Germany, you don't need this. If you don't have this, you can show last 3 or 6 months of rent payment from your bank account statement, along with your contract.
- SCHUFA:  You can get one for free (datenkopie) or paid through MeineSchufa. Short term apartments generally do not ask for SCHUFA.
- Application form (Selbstauskunft) - when available: If your landlord sent you an application form, fill it out, print it and take it to the appointment.


### Registering for www.WG-Gesucht.de
Necessary for registration:

- Anrede (how you want to be addressed)
- Vorname (name)
- Nachname (last name)
- E-Mail-Adresse (Email) 
- Eigenes Passwort (password) 

Make your profile stand out with details.

## Wg gesucht - how to start a search 

- Write ‘egal’ for better chances
- Describe yourself in German and English to increase your chances - why should your future flatmates choose you? What do you enjoy doing? What are you looking for?
- Give details about what you’re looking for. Mandatory details are dates, maximum rent and your income.

## Answering an advert on WG-Gesucht
You have to sell yourself to your future house mates to make sure you get the room. And this itself consists of two battles. Firstly, your initial contact (either via phone or email) must interest them enough to get an invite to inspect the room and meet them in person.

And once there, then you must convince them that you are the best candidate for the room. Your initial contact must convince them that it is worth their time meeting you. 
If they have specified any details in their ad, this is the time to address them.  If they say they are looking for someone quiet you could mention that you like to read and ask them if they do.

If they are looking for outgoing social people, ask them who their favorite DJ or band is, if they play any musical instruments and if they go out to many live gigs or concerts. If all goes well, you will get an invite to inspect the room and meet them. Show your interest by asking questions about them and the flatshare life.
Go to the inspection on your own. 

## Writing your introduction message / application 
These platforms require you to write an Introduction message (Nachricht) when applying for an apartment, or send a message via the contact form (Kontaktanfrage an ...) on the listing. Use the language that the flat offer is written in (German - use Deepl to translate -  or English). 

Include information about yourselves, such as:
- Names
- Resident statuses e.g. long-term residency, student status 
- What you do for work/study
- That you can afford the rent (3x cold rent is expected) - proof 
- Anything else that makes you appear trustworthy and reliable!

## Find a German-speaking friend!
It is very very helpful to find a German-speaking friend, and even better, someone who has lived in Berlin for several years, for to your housing search!

Social networks are very important here - lots of people find their flats through friends of friends. 

They can also help you with translation of housing website profiles, application letters and responses, and maybe even prevent discrimination if they accompany you to flat viewings.

## Time pressure
Adverts go very very quickly (sometimes within 15 minutes of posting), so you need to factor in a good amount of time for your search. 

Ideally, you want to dedicate some quality time to sitting at your computer and responding to new adverts within the first 5 minutes of them being online. 

Sort the adverts by newest first:  Aktualität (neueste zuerst). 

## What to watch out for 
- Anmeldung possible
- Staffelmiete
- Furniture fee
- Bribes
- High Nebenkosten (any plans to increase them? Esp. gas prices) 
- What is included in the Nebenkosten? (Sometimes only heating, not cooking gas is included, sometimes electricity is…) 
- Minimum renting time/Mindestmietdauer (sometimes contracts have a minimum renting time of two years) 
- Deposit/Kaution  amount and use of separate account to save it in
- Weird demands from landlords
- See the flat and meet the landlord before you sign a contract or send money
- Never send money in advance of signing the contract
- Staffelmiete - legally, your landlord cannot increase your rent within the first 12 months of your tenancy contract, or by more than 20% (15% in some federal states) over a three-year period. Some landlords, therefore, charge “stepped rent” (Staffelmiete), that increases gradually over time.  A schedule for any rent increases will be included in your tenancy agreement. It is worth noting that, if your landlord charges you stepped rent, additional rent increases are not permitted.
- Airbnb link scam - when a landlord offers you a flat but says they’re abroad, and airbnb is managing the property for them. They then send a dodgy airbnb link to request money from you. When it’s too good to be true, be extra cautious [More scam info here.](/en/spot-the-scam/)

## Apartment viewings
- **Private**: They invite you to a private viewing where you are allocated 10 to 15 minutes. This can be just you, or with a limited set of other applicants (2 to 3). Private viewing gives you the best shot at making an impression. 
- **Public**: You and 100 other applicants show up to an apartment viewing. You queue up outside the apartment and go inside in a bunch.

We recommend that you bring your documents with you, so you’re ready to apply if you like the flat. Otherwise send by email as soon as possible afterwards. Then send a follow up email a few days later to say how interested you are.  

### Follow up email 
— greeting here
Wir möchten uns dafür bedanken, dass Sie sich heute die Zeit genommen haben uns die Wohnung zu zeigen. Sie hat uns wirklich sehr gut gefallen. Wir freuen uns schon auf Ihre Rückmeldung, und nochmals vielen Dank für den Termin!

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

## What to check in a contract
- Your landlord’s name and full address
- Address and description of the property
- Start and end dates (if applicable - befristet contracts)
- Agreed monthly rent and method of payment
- Deposit (Kaution)
- Additional costs and / or utilities (e.g. energy (gas and electricity), water, internet, phone)
- Specific house rules, relating e.g. to smoking, pets, subletting rooms, structural changes and redecoration
- Landlord’s duties, with regards to maintenance and repairs
- Notice period for terminating the contract
- Inventory list / Übergabeprotokoll
- Notice about any rent increases

## Why is a rental contract important?
- You can register in the city (Anmeldung) which gets you a tax ID and access to other services.
- You can join a renters’ union e.g. Mieterschutzbund or Mieterverein. 
- Your rights are better protected. 
- You can then sublet (with your landlord’s permission) if you need to. 
- You need a registered address for work and visa applications.  


## Terminating a Contract
You must give your landlord 3 months notice (check your contract to see if it says anything different) of your plans to move out. To give notice, you must send a letter/ Kundigungsschreiben (not an email) to the landlord.

You must cancel before the 3rd work day of the month. For example, if you cancel on January 1, your lease will end on March 31. The cancellation period starts when the landlord gets your cancellation letter, not when you send it.

You should use registered post - per Enschreiben or Zustellungsbescheinigung - to send the letter, as then the landlord can’t pretend it didn’t arrive.

If you are still in your ‘Mindestmietdauer’ (minimum rental term, normally 1-2 years), you can give your landlord 3 months notice and then find a suitable tenant to replace you. You will be in charge of viewings, and you will need to send prospective tenants’ applications to the landlord for them to choose.

https://www.immobilienscout24.de/umzugsexpose/musterbrief-kuendigung.html - template for termination letters

### Landlord’s notice
The amount of notice a landlord is required to give depends on how long the tenant has been living in the property: Minimum time in property: 0 - 5 years = 3 months; 5-8 years = 6 months; 8+ years = 9 months

This minimum notice period only applies if the landlord wishes to turn the property over to personal use. If you have violated your rental contract by failing to pay rent or subletting, the landlord is entitled to terminate the contract without notice. You have the right, however, to protest against the termination and the matter may be taken to court (this process can take around 6 months, during which you can stay in the flat).

## Your Tenant Rights
- Deposits: The deposit can be 1 - max. 3 months’ cold rent (Kaltmiete)
- Take an inventory/Übergabeprotokoll  to ensure that all existing damage is recorded.Do not let the landlord do this without you, and do not sign the document if you don’t agree with it. 
- The landlord will take up to 6 months to return your deposit. If there is nothing to repair, you will get the whole deposit back. If something needs to be repaired, the landlord will pay for the repairs with your deposit. If they say there is damage, but no inventory exists, they have no right to charge you for anything. They also can’t charge you for repairs for anything not mentioned in the inventory. 

### Rental terms:
- **Unbefristet**: an unlimited lease contract, which may have a minimum rental period (1 or 2 years). After this period, you can leave the flat with 3 months notice. 
- **Befristet**: a fixed term contract e.g. 1 year. Note: this cannot be ended earlier by the landlord, even if they want to live in the flat again.

### Rent increases
The landlord cannot increase the cold rent within the first 12 months. The landlord is allowed however to increase the rent up to 15% within a 3 year period. But this increase should be justified. The landlord cannot increase the rent when someone joins you on the rental contract.

Use the Mietspiegel or speak to a renters’ union if you think you are being unfairly charged.

### Evictions
You’re safe from sudden evictions. Every tenant in Germany is protected by the legal notice of contract termination of at least 3 months. 

### Eigenbedarfskündigung
Eigenbedarfskündigung means that the landlord can reclaim his or her flat for their or their direct family´s usage within 3-12 months, depending on how long you lived in the flat. 

You can ask them for proof that they are going to move in, and they are bound to provide it.

A new law concerning Eigenbedarfskündigung makes it harder for ´new´ landlords to kick you out. Let's assume your flat gets bought, the new landlord has to wait for 10 years until he or she can move in via Eigenbedarfskündigung. 

### Mietspiegel / ‘Rent mirror’
A ´Mietspiegel`gives you an idea of the average rent in your area / apartment block. It is useful to see if you are paying more than you should be. 

Check your address and enter details about your flat to get to know how much your rent should be according to the `Mietspiegel´. 
https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/wohnen/mietspiegel/


### Mietpreisbremse
The rent brake applies exclusively to the rental of residential space. It has been in force since 2015 and is valid until May 31, 2025. When a new lease is signed, the new rent may not exceed the local comparative rent (shown on the Mietspiegel) by more than 10 percent. If you are paying more than 10% above average rents, you can use the Mietpreisbremse mechanism to get a refund or reduction from your landlord. Renters’ unions come in useful here!

**Note**: if your landlord says your rent is higher than the average because of e.g. furniture rental cost / nebenkosten etc, and this isn’t made clear in your contract, then your right to Mietpreisbremse then is even more clear.

E.g. If your contract says cold rent = 1000 euro, nebenkosten = 300, and your Vermieter says oh because the cold rent covers x and y, but the contract doesn’t state that it includes that, then from a legal POV, it just looks like they’re overcharging you (which they are anyway).

Also, if they say it’s a furniture fee, then talk to the Mieterschutzbund, as they can calculate using a specific formula what a fair fee/rental would be, and then you can get a refund on the rest. 

### Furniture fees:
If your landlord charges you for furniture/a fitted kitchen etc when you move in, and this is part of your contract/emails exchanged before moving in, you may be eligible to get some of it back.

Take the contract and the amount to your renters’ union, who will perform the necessary calculations and check the amount was fair. If it wasn’t, the landlord is obliged to repay you. 

### Admin/processing fees
Are illegal. If you pay them to a landlord, you can request to be repaid after signing the contract.

**Note**: if you pay a bribe to a previous tenant, then you are not protected.

### Eigenbedarfskündigung / Termination Notice for Personal Use
Take out tenancy protection insurance (Mietrechtsschutzversicherung). Do this early (NOW!). Most insurance policies have a lead time before they can be used to claim. 
Keep calm after the first shock! 

Seek legal advice immediately or get advice from an experienced lawyer:
- Is the termination even legally valid?
- Is the party giving notice legitimate?
- Does the house belong to a private landlord or has it been converted into condominiums?
- Does the notice of termination state the date of termination?
- Does the notice state the date of termination and the right of objection? 
- Is the person moving in named?
- Are the reasons for the owner-occupied accommodation given in detail?

Get in touch with your neighbours and tenants' initiatives and network. Do not object to the notice of termination until shortly before the expiry of the objection period, otherwise you could be evicted prematurely.

Keep the landlords in the dark as long as possible about whether you are moving out or not.

Go to the land registry to clarify ownership and to get information about other flats and houses owned by the landlords. It may be important for your own proceedings, but definitely for a possible networking among tenants who have the same landlord.

[Find more information about Eigenbedarfskündigung here.](https://www.wem-gehoert-kreuzberg.de/index.php/bleibe-n) 

### Subletters’ Rights
**Permission**: The main tenant should seek permission from their landlord to sublet. Their reasons for subletting can be social or financial. This is usually granted, although many people seem to fear that it won’t be. 

The landlord MUST give the tenant their permission if they simply want to share the flat with someone else, but they are not obliged to  if they want to sublet the whole place without being there.

**Contracts**: Proof of rent payment to the main tenant/your landlord + permission from their landlord to sublet = your contract. Standard contract terms apply in this case. You can join a renters’ union on this basis. The renters’ union can mediate between you and the main tenant only.

Subletting: BMV call this situation ‘precarious tenancy’ - when you are subletting without permission and have no access to the actual landlord. No numbers exist on subletters in the city, but precarious tenancy is an increasing problem. However, it might not be as precarious as you think!

**Without permission** - if the landlord finds out, he can terminate the whole tenancy. 

**Taking action**: If the subletter and the main tenant are in a verein, and you both want change from the landlord, then you can bring action against them. A subletter cannot bring action vs the landlord alone. 

**Anmeldung**: The main tenant must issue the subletter with a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung to show proof of their residence. Very rarely the Bürgeramt might ask for the main tenant’s contract with their landlord, or the landlord’s permission to sublet. 

‘No Anmeldung possible’ - probably means the main tenant is scared and has not asked permission from their landlord. 

Good luck!
